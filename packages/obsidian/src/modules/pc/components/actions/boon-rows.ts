/**
 * A single Interdict Boon row on the consolidated Actions tab (spec §3.6 / #1b).
 *
 * The tab (`actions-tab.ts`) files boons into the economy×source grid model via
 * `buildActionModel` and dispatches each `boon` entry here — this renderer owns
 * ONE read-only row (+ its hidden expand card); it emits no head, no count.
 * Picking stays exclusively on the Interdict Boons pool tab, so these rows never
 * carry the pool tab's select/deselect toggle-box.
 *
 * Rows reuse the unified feature-row grid ([badge][name][detail][caret]), so
 * boon rows visually match the feature rows beside them.
 *   - Badge = the boon's ECONOMY pill, read from its OWN `action_cost` (a real
 *     cost → filled `renderCostBadge` pill; special/no-cost → outline "Passive"
 *     tag), mirroring the feature-row badge rule. The section can't supply this:
 *     `boonEconomy` collapses free→passive, so a granted Free boon must key its
 *     FREE pill (and its non-dimming) off the raw `action_cost`, not the bucket.
 *   - Detail = the provenance/state marker: an **Active** toggle (activatable
 *     selected — `pc-pool-active`, wired to `editState.toggleActiveBuff(slug)`,
 *     the same control the pool tab uses) / a quiet `pc-boon-status` "granted"
 *     marker (granted) / nothing (plain selected).
 * Clicking a row (outside the Active toggle) expands the shared
 * `.archivist-item-block` card with the boon's description.
